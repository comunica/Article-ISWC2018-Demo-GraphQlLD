## Conclusions
{:#conclusions}

In this work, we propose GraphQL-LD as a technique for combining the worlds of GraphQL and the Semantic Web.
We provide an implementation of this approach, and demonstrate this with a set of example queries.

In future work, we intend to formalize our GraphQL-LD conversion algorithm.
Furthermore, we intend to improve the way in which we determine which variables
should be considered singular or plural.
OWL's `InverseFunctionalProperty` or JSON-LD framing are potential options that we consider for this.

In summary, this work allows GraphQL developers to query the Linked Open Data cloud.
But also Linked Data experts can use it an an alternative to SPARQL.
